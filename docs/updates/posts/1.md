# Hello World

Welcome to Pivot Atlas, a cyber threat intel pivoting handbook developed by [Amitai Cohen](https://twitter.com/AmitaiCo). Please check out the [main page](/) to learn more.

This website is a work in progress, but it's reached the point where I feel ready to share it with others. I would very much appreciate any feedback on the implementation, structure and content. Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmitaiCo) if you'd like to chat about it, or simply create an issue in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/korniko98/pivot-atlas/issues/new) to submit ideas or special requests.

Pivot Atlas is built using [Martin Donath](https://x.com/squidfunk)'s wonderful [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and its design is inspired by [Nick Frichette](https://x.com/frichette_n)'s [Hacking the Cloud](https://hackingthe.cloud/) project, MITRE's [D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) matrix, [Joe Slowik](https://twitter.com/jfslowik)'s body of work on the science of pivoting, and [John Lambert](https://x.com/JohnLaTwC)'s evergreen encouragement for defenders to [think in graphs](https://github.com/JohnLaTwC/Shared/blob/master/Defenders%20think%20in%20lists.%20Attackers%20think%20in%20graphs.%20As%20long%20as%20this%20is%20true%2C%20attackers%20win.md).

UPDATE (2024-06-17): Special thanks to [Noah McDonald](https://twitter.com/TheIceRoot), [Rami McCarthy](https://x.com/ramimacisabird), [Danielle Aminov](https://twitter.com/AminovDanielle) and others for providing valuable early feedback to this project. I've made a few small structural changes, added more content, and also fixed several broken links.

**Current status:**

```
- Artifact section lists most basic pivots.
- Artifact section includes high-level descriptions of listed pivots.
- Artifact section includes explanations and descriptions of malicious usecases.
- Artifact section includes some real-world historic examples for certain pivots.
- Artifact section includes some "minimaps" for pivots showing detailed analysis flow.
- Artifact section includes some URL and API examples for certain pivots.
- Fingerprints page includes high-level descriptions of each fingerprint type.
- Map page includes full map of pivots mentioned elsewhere on the website.
- Impact page describes how to operationalize information about newly uncovered malicious infrastructure.
- Tips page provides guidelines on how to make the most of pivoting.
- Tool page includes high-level descriptions of each tool type.
- Tool page includes tool comparison table.
```

**Future plans:**

```
- Add more artifact types, including cloud-focused artifacts such as account IDs.
- Add more pivot types, especially sample-focused pivots such as registry keys, file names, etc.
- Incorporate threat actor behavior, habits, and patterns as artifacts and pivots (e.g., naming conventions).
- Add case study pages with real-world summaries of investigations, including corresponding pivot maps.
- Add call-outs to artifact pages with useful tips on how to make the most of each artifact.
- Clarify which tool type enables each pivot, with links to the relevant tool page section.
- Elaborate on fingerprint types (such as adding details about each JA4+ fingerprint).
- Add screenshots of commonly used platforms in the tools and artifacts sections.
- Add more real-world historic examples.
- Add more URL and API examples.
- Add more "minimaps".
